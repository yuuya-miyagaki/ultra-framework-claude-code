# Ultra Framework Claude Code

## Operating Contract

- Thin Claude Code operating model. Claude orchestrates routing.
- Hard gates require explicit user approval.
- Completion requires evidence, not chat confidence.
- Load only docs required for the current task.
- Use framework phases, not `EnterPlanMode`.
- Persist lessons in `docs/LEARNINGS.md`. Auto-memory may store personal preferences only; it must not duplicate LEARNINGS.
- Stop after 3 failures toward the same goal: write `docs/second-opinion.md`,
  update STATUS.md blockers, recommend IDE chat, then wait.
  Count by goal, not method. TDD red-to-green cycles excluded.
  Record each failure in STATUS.md `failure_tracking` (goal/count/last_attempt).
  Reset to null when the goal is achieved or changed.
- Destructive commands require explicit user approval. Enforce via hooks (PaC).
- Hook enforcement level is set at install via `bin/setup.sh --profile`.

## Session Start

1. Read `docs/STATUS.md`.
2. Read only `current_refs` relevant to the task.
3. Pull extra docs only when a dependency appears.
4. Invoke subagents only when isolation reduces risk or context.
5. Update `docs/STATUS.md` when phase, refs, blockers, or next step change.

## State Machine

Modes: `Client`, `Dev`. Hard gates control transitions.
Client: onboard→discovery→requirements→scope→acceptance→handover
Dev: brainstorm→plan→implement→review→qa→security→deploy→ship→docs
Details in `.claude/rules/state-machine.md`.

## Routing

Subagents only when they make work clearer, safer, or smaller.
Details in `.claude/rules/routing.md`.

## Context Budget Policy

L0 `CLAUDE.md`+`STATUS.md` (always-on), L1 phase refs, L2 task files, L3 on-demand.

- Prefer repo files over chat history. Pull-based; max three docs at once.
- Summarize at phase transitions. Update `docs/STATUS.md` before pauses.

## Skills

Skills live in `.claude/skills/`. Load for the current phase only.

- brainstorming, bug-diagnosis, tdd, subagent-dev
- deploy, client-workflow, session-recovery, ship-and-docs
- review, security-review, qa-verification, docs-sync

## Source of Truth

- Operating rules: `CLAUDE.md`
- Current phase and next action: `docs/STATUS.md`
- Requirements: `docs/requirements/*`
- Design and plans: `docs/specs/*`, `docs/plans/*`
- Review, QA, and security evidence: `docs/qa-reports/*`
- Skills: named skills
- Actual behavior: code, tests, and command output
- Optional addons: `extensions/` (manual opt-in, not in core contract)

## Completion Rule

A task is only complete when:

- the relevant artifact exists
- zero-tool-call completions are invalid
- the relevant checks have been run or explicitly skipped with reason
- `docs/STATUS.md` points to the active refs
- blockers and residual risks are recorded
- the completion summary is evidence-based
