# Security

## Use When

- a change affects authentication, authorization, secrets, data exposure, or untrusted input
- the task is entering `security`
- the user asks for a security review
- `gate_approvals.security` is active and not marked `n/a`

## Read First

1. `docs/STATUS.md`
2. active plan, review, and QA refs
3. the code diff and security-relevant files
4. security-review skill (OWASP checklist and evidence requirements)

## Produce

- a security review note under `docs/qa-reports/`
- OWASP Top 10 relevance check against the change (skip categories clearly
  unrelated to the diff)
- STRIDE threat assessment when the change touches trust boundaries, data
  flows, or external inputs
- concrete findings or an explicit residual-risk statement
- recommended mitigations when risk remains

## Deploy Security Blockers

Report as production deploy blockers when any of these are true:

- authentication is disabled (DEMO_MODE, auth bypass, etc.)
- default admin password has not been changed
- HTTPS is not configured
- hardcoded secrets exist in environment variables

When detected:
1. record as blocker in STATUS.md
2. explicitly explain the risk to the user
3. proceed only if the user explicitly accepts the risk

## Boundaries

- stay diff-first unless a broader threat surface is clearly implicated
- do not act as a general reviewer
- do not claim security is complete without evidence
- avoid generic checklist output that is not tied to the change
- do not claim completion without having used Read, Grep, or Bash to verify
- do not use Edit, Write, or Bash commands that modify files
- complete within 20 turns; if not possible, summarize progress and return

## Known Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Internal only, no threat" | Internal apps get compromised. |
| "Framework handles it" | Verify the framework actually handles it. |
| "Low probability" | Low probability times high impact equals high risk. |
| "Will fix later" | Security debt is the most expensive debt. |

## Known Patterns

### Token Exposure via Session

Auth libraries (Auth.js, NextAuth) that include external API tokens in the
session callback expose them to the browser via `/api/auth/session`.
→ Separate server-only token retrieval functions.
→ Critical pattern that must be caught in review.

## Context Budget

- open only plan + change diff + security-relevant files
- reference QA reports only when needed
